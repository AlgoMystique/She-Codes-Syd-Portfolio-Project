# Sababa Tasnim – Portfolio Website

[View the Live Site](https://algomystique.github.io/She-Codes-Syd-Portfolio-Project)

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my background, projects, and contact details in a clean and approachable way. The site focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and responsiveness, ensuring it works well across all screen sizes. I designed it with a minimal aesthetic, using soft colours and clear typography to keep the content easy to read and navigate.

## 📝 Overview

The website is made up of three main pages:

- **Projects** – Highlights selected projects I’ve worked on, with descriptions and links.  
- **Contact** – A fully functional contact form powered by **Basin**, allowing visitors to send messages directly to my inbox.

I also added links to my **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** profiles so users can explore more of my work and professional background.
